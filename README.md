# ErrorHandlingExample Contract

## Overview
This Solidity smart contract demonstrates different error handling mechanisms available in Solidity version ^0.8.0.

## Contract Functions
- **increment(uint _value)**: Increments the `count` by the specified `_value`. It utilizes the `require` statement to ensure that `_value` is greater than zero.
- **decrement(uint _value)**: Decrements the `count` by the specified `_value`. It checks if `_value` is greater than the current `count` and reverts with a message if the condition is met.
- **assertExample(uint _a, uint _b)**: Performs addition of `_a` and `_b` and asserts that the result is greater than or equal to `_a`. If the assertion fails, the transaction is reverted.

## Error Handling Mechanisms
- **require**: Used to validate conditions and revert if not met.
- **revert**: Used to revert the transaction with a custom error message.
- **assert**: Used to check for internal errors and revert if the condition is not met.

## Usage
1. Deploy the contract to a compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment.
2. Interact with the contract using the provided functions.
3. Use the different functions to observe error handling in action.
